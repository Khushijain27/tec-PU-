		<u>The University is participating in various prestigious International High Energy Research Programmes at Fermilab (USA), KEK (Japan) and CERN (Switzerland). At present, the University is involved in a big way in CMS and ALICE Experiments at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) Switzerland and Neutrino Programme at Fermilab, USA. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) project at the Large Hadron Collider is for the discovery of Higgs Boson and other new particles. Under such International Research programs, the University had earlier been involved in the Top Quark Discovery (1995) and CP-violation discovery (2001).</u></h2>
